# Groundfish Shiny App
This project creates an R Shiny app for the spatial distribution of Oregon groundfishes. Data is displayed using the [leaflet package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), which is a JavaScript library used to make interactive maps like this one. To access the app, run the [app.R script](C:/Users/howar/Documents/R/Groundfish_Shiny/app.R). You can then select between five commercially important groundfish species and look at the spatial patterns of their distributions. This can be done by year, 2003 through 2019, and by size of the fish (length in mm). 

The data used for this project are from the [NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center Bottom Trawl Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/us-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey).
